# PEP Dashboard

Welcome to the PEP Dashboard!

The power in this database comes from the information being populated and updated. The following fields should be completed for all activities:
* Activity Lead
* Activity Type
* Planned Start/End Date (as narrow of a time window as possible)
* Actual End Date (when the work is completed)

A few things to help you get started:
* Use the links on the right to navigate to different sections of the documentation. 
* Please use the "Issues" page for ideas or suggestions of things that would be useful within the database.
* Pleass reference the "Wiki" page for more information about the database.
* If there's a catastrophic issue, please email or chat Stacie!
* I recommend adding a "data sharing" milestone activity to appropriate projects to ensure we're meeting PARR requirements and achieving an open data approach within the program.

Terms:
* **Activity Plan**: These are research plans designed and maintained to meet the AFSC planning, prioritization, and budgeting process. The title and area of focus for “core and constant” plans are not likely to change. More ephemeral activity plans may exist to accommodate external funds or special initiative funds that come to PEP.
* **Component**: These represent key themes and areas of research interest within the parent activity plan. These serve as organizational groupings to help identify areas of collaboration/ coordination and for allocation of key leadership/management responsibilities. Components may exist as long as needed.
* **Project**: These represent a common unit of team organization, distribution of roles, and allocation of time and energy for PEP personnel, and each project should have a set of identified activities. Distribution of roles is important for each project and timelines should be identified up front (and revisited regularly).
* **Action**: These represent the markers driving the timeline for the project and can represent tangible, deliverable digital items that we produce in support of the activity plan. They help communicate both deadlines, as well as the drivers for those deadlines. Milestones will help guide communication and planning with the team and between projects. All activities should be assigned a lead and a planned end date.
